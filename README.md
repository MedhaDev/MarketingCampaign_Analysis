# Data Analysis â€“ Personal Projects

This repository contains a collection of personal projects created as part of my preparation for data analyst interviews. These small, focused exercises help reinforce my skills in SQL, Python, and data analysis techniques.


## About

The goal of this repository is to document my learning process through hands-on practice. Each project is self-contained and typically explores one or more of the following areas:

- SQL query writing and optimization
- Data analysis with Python (pandas, numpy)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleaning, transforming, and visualizing data
- Business problem solving through analytics


## Tools and Technologies

- SQL (CTEs, subqueries, joins, and window functions)
- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebooks


## Structure

Each folder or notebook in this repository is a standalone project. Most include:

- A short problem description or context
- A Python notebook or SQL script
- Comments explaining the logic behind the code and results


## Notes

This is a personal learning space, so some projects are works in progress or designed to explore specific concepts rather than present polished solutions.
